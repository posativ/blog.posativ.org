[CoudApp][1] allows you to share any kind of data with your friends using
Amazon S3 as backend. It provides a verbose API and has several working
clients for iPhone, iPad and Android as well. [Cloud.app][2] is a really
handy, extendable Mac-client leaving nothing to be desired. CloudApp offers a
*Pro* mode, allowing you to share data up to 250 Mb and unlimited uploads as
well as links to your domain. For free you'll get 10 uploads per day and a
filesize limit of 25 MiB.

I had some [leisure time][3] and found out, CloudApp's services is similar to
Facebooks privacy options. Their security/privacy (marked as “private”) relies
simply on a longer hash than their (per default) [public][4] [items][5]
starting as three-character hash.

I don't read their terms of service, but I guess they are similar to DropBox;
means you have no rights on your uploaded data, Patriot Act and so on. Btw,
they're using [Pusher](http://pusherapp.com) for whatever reason. Privacy is
not compatible with CloudApp as I've seen with `tcpdump` so far. But their
Desktop-Clients are cool (with a carrot and a stick).

# [Regenwolken](https://github.com/posativ/regenwolken/)

Regenwolken is an alternate (incomplete) server implementation written in
[python](http://python.org/), [bottly.py](http://bottlepy.org/) and
[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), which is compatible with *Cloud.app*
(Mac-Client) and circumvents any Free/Pro restriction. Its has support for
their basic, unencrypted authentication (no wait, it's [digest][10] auth!1),
unlimited file uploading, file size limit and a powerful database backend.

Regenwolken can run either as stand-alone HTTP-server on port 80 or on as unprivileged user
and using some `mod_proxy`-magic. Unfortunately it requires access to /etc/hosts
to redirect *my.cl.ly* to your own server address. This will not break any
“official” CloudApp links (*cl.ly*) and is only required for the upload itself.
Other people get a normal, non-/etc/hosts hacked, ~~[working link][12]~~.

Regenwolken is licensed under BSD, two-clause and can be found on
[GitHub][7]. Check [README.md][8] and [Issues][9] as well. Don't expect
a full featured server API yet, it's currently ~~[0.1-alpha][11] ~~[0.5][13].
